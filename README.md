gridsheet

The gridsheet is an attempt to create a jquery plugin to simulate SpreadSheet capabilities. We take Excel, Google sheets or other spreadsheet products for granted. But, we often dont realise the complexities that were tackled by the developers working on the spreadsheet applications that we use daily. I am daring to dive into this territory and uncover and address the complexities that the developers of some well known spreadsheet programs have come across. I will try my best the adhere to the best programming practices and keep the code readable, as this will not just be a learning opportunity for me; but, might also help others to understand how a spreadsheet program can be built.
